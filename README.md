# Location Recommendation System

### This project constructed three basic recommendation models and then obtained a comprehensive recommendation model
* user-based collaborative filtering model (**not** in this repo)
* random walk based friend similarity model (in this repo)
* residence-based personalized geographic location model (**not** in this repo)

The data and the topic of our coursework can be found in [requirement](2021课程设计.docx).

The [report](机器学习大作业——推荐算法.pdf) describes the algorithms and our system in details.

**My main contribute code is [data exploration](code/数据探索.ipynb) and [random walk based friend
similarity model](code/Graph%20Analysis.ipynb)**
